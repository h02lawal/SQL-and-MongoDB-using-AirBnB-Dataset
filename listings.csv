As a little girl, I always admired the way a space and its’ contents have the ability to create memories and feelings. One of my earliest realizations of that experience was when my family and I spend a Christmas at a refugee camp when I was 10 years old. We had just escaped communism, leaving everything behind, yet my parents managed to create for us a lovely corner in our room with a small decorated Christmas tree, a bowl of nuts, some Mandarins, and even a few small presents. I still remember wondering how they managed to put this together for my sister and me? It was the loveliest feeling and that wonderful memory is still vivid in my mind as one of my very favorite Christmases. 

Perhaps it is this experience in leaving our life and all our worldly possessions behind to start again, which makes me always pause in a space and take in how it makes me feel. I truly believe in the wonder and emotional connection to the things that we choose to surround ourselves with. 

I have also been fortunate to put my head down on a pillow in many lovely places during my 20 years of executive global travel. I have come to appreciate that there are a few essentials that have always put a smile on my face and made me feel at home while traveling away from home. It is with this mindset that my family and I have approached the creation of this loft, our special space. 

A beautifully-appointed loft, with comfy bedding and linens, lovely amenities, all the comforts of home, and an opportunity to connect with locals, are but a few of the things that we hope our home and family can offer. We are passionate about our city and would love to share everything that may be of interest to you about Winnipeg. There is so much to discover and talk about in English, French, or Czech if you prefer.
We look forward to meeting you.

We are so excited to host you during your stay! Being avid travelers ourselves, we love the experience AirBNB has provided being able to experience life as one of the locals in wherever we're going. We wanted to give the same experience to people visiting our properties and be able to provide the most incredible accommodations to all of our guests.

We obsess over every detail and have an incredible team to ensure our properties are cleaned and maintained to the highest standard prior to your visit. Our guests' book with us for a reason, and we'd love to host you for you to find out why.

Currently we are helping homeowners from across the country manage their investment properties / vacation rentals by welcoming guests into their homes through our property management business, Blue Bell Properties. We are a hands-on short term rental management company and handle all the logistical work that goes into managing short term rentals. Showcasing these properties to look their best and bring in higher returns for our partners and investors is just a small part of what we do.

If you like the idea of short term rentals, but simply don't want to handle the day to day management of dealing with guests, coordinating maid staff and maintenance, managing your calendar, and marketing your property to earn the highest nightly rates possible, feel free to contact us and we'd be happy to have a complimentary consultation with you and see if we are a good fit for your needs. We look forward to serving you and making your short term rental experience as hands off as possible and something you’ll love for years to come!

With my passion for all things beautiful, delicious, and culturally diverse, I've made a name for myself in the world of food and hospitality, having opened my own restaurant and built a reputation for creating stunning dishes and memorable dining experiences.

As a former Senior Logistics Officer, I have a unique perspective on the importance of comfort and convenience, and I've incorporated these principles into our Airbnb listing. My home is designed to provide guests with a relaxing and worry-free stay, whether they're here for business or pleasure. From the cozy bedding to the fully equipped kitchen, I've thought of every detail to make your stay as enjoyable as possible.

When I'm not in the kitchen or at my restaurant, you can find me exploring new destinations, discovering new music, and soaking up local cultures. My love for travel and adventure has taken me to some of the most amazing places in the world, and I can't wait to share my stories and recommendations with you.

So, whether you're a foodie looking to experience the best of local cuisine, a music lover looking for new tunes, or simply in need of a comfortable and convenient place to stay, I'm here to make your stay unforgettable. I look forward to hosting you soon!

Mexico is my second home. Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta are my main destinations for Mexico . I spend one month there in Nov and 1 month in March.

It is the dolce Vita ( sweet life) ,sunny and day time temps of about +28.

I  enjoy hosting on Airbnb mainly because I like meeting new people and having people come from around the world. I use Airbnb whenever I can for traveling around the world because it is so affordable.   Dom and his wife Jessica live close by my home and are co hosts with my airbnb.
