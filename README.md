I tried a few SQL and MongoDB queries on sample data. One of the datasets i created myself with a few publicly available information and the other AirBnB dataset 
i got from a free online source. I was able to execute complex queries which include multiple levels of nested queries.


Note: The AirBnB dataset doesn't belong to me and was gotten from a free online source.
